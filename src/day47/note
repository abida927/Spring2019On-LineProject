side node : make sure to have naming conflict with existing methods  
		 

	Instance block 
		it's a block of code that run every time an object 
		is being created right before constructor class 
		
		{
			your code goes here 
		}
	 How is this useful ? 
	 	if you have block of code that shared among 
	 	all of your constructor , 
	 	you can put it in instance block to reduce duplicate 
	 
	ANY OCA QUESTION YOU GOT ABOUT INSTANCE BLOCK 
		just copy everything inside instance block and insert it into each and every constructor 

	
	
	
	static methods VS instance method 
	
		
		instance method should be used if you want to read or manipulate properties or state of object 
		
		static method -- most of the time it's used for utility methods 
			 if your method is doing no action to  read or manipulate properties or state of object 
			 you may just use static method
