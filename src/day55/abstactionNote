                         Abstraction:

1.abstract class are not meant to be instantiated
2.abstract class are meant to be super class
3.to provide a general idea, without implementation  details
  using abstract method
4.ABSTRACT METHOD MUST BE IN ABSTRACT CLASS
  HOWEVER
  A ABSTRACT CLASS DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE ABSTRACT METHOD
  
  THE ONLY EFFECT OF MAKING THIS ABSTRACT AT THIS MOMENT 
  IS TO PREVENT OBJECT IS BEING CREATED OF THIS CLASS

Other than above--->
YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE A NORMAL CALSS CAN HAVE


eg:
  
   public abstract class Student {

     int id; 
     String name; 
  
     public abstract void attendClass() ; 
     
  }
